            <div class="col-12  mb-5 px-5 " style="color: #04547b;font-size:18px;font-weight: 300;font-family: 'Quicksand';line-height: 35px;">Heart It Out began humbly as a ‘Room on the Roof’ in a quaint neighbourhood, providing a safe space for people to talk their hearts out. Today, it is a tech platform poised to provide confidential and non-judgemental access to mental healthcare, to 1.5 billion people by 2030.
            </div>
            <div class="col-12 mb-5 px-5" style="color: #04547b;font-size:18px;font-weight: 300;font-family: 'Quicksand';line-height: 35px;">Arising from the grim reality of mental health care and its inaccessibility in India, our vision to build a solution-driven initiative has gradually materialised and strengthened into a holistic, technology-driven platform for global impact. We have learnt more than we thought we could, failed more often than we were willing to, and pushed through obstacles. Our work evolvolves constantly, drawing inspiration from organisations and entrepreneurs that are passionate and committed to the grassroots, where change begins.
            </div>
            <div class="col-12  mb-5 px-5" style="color: #04547b;font-size:18px;font-weight: 300;font-family: 'Quicksand';line-height: 35px;">When we embarked on the journey to provide psychotherapy in 2018, to people experiencing mental health concerns like anxiety and depression, we soon realised that psychotherapy is too narrow to reach out to those who need more than therapy and medical treatment. Compelled to innovate, we have, since then, created a range of services, rooted in South Asian cultures and informed by socio-political reality.</div>

We aim to make mental healthcare accessible to 1.5 billion people by 2030 through innovation and disruption of the current healthcare system.
